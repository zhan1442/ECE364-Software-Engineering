# ECE364-Software-Engineering-Tools-Laboratory

======

A repository for course ECE364 in Spring2016. Scripting languages, and application programming languages.

Learning Objectives:
A student who successfully fulfills the course requirements will have demonstrated:

    an ability to use scripting languages to integrate the input/output of diverse software systems.
    an ability to apply testing techniques to assess software reliability and correctness.
    an ability to design modern user interfaces.
    an understanding of regular expressions.
    an ability to design and incorporate classes in their programs.
    an ability to incorporate associative arrays in their programs. 

Assessment Method for Learning Objectives: Each outcome is associated with multiple tasks in laboratory exercises, items in practical exams, and/or specific requirements in the final project. The following list enumerates the tasks which students must complete at least once during the semester. Items 1 and 2 correspond to outcome "i." for each of the scripting languages taught in ECE36400. Items 3 through 7 correspond one to one with outcomes "ii." through "vi." 1. Student has successfully written a Bash script which interacts with the operating system. 2. Student has successfully written a Python script which interacts with the operating system. 3. Student has successfully tested a Python program for software reliability and correctness. 4. Student has successfully written a Python script which uses an interactive user interface. 5. Student has successfully written a Python script which requires the use of regular expressions. 6. Student has successfully written a Python program which requires the design and use of Python classes. 7. Student has successfully written a Python program which requires the design and use of associative arrays.
